# Quard Cropter project

In this project I'm trying to add extra functionality to the quard. I think the idea like this - There should be an arduino in between the receiver of the quard and the flight controller. After receiving the data from the receiver the arduino process the data by measuring varios sensor data and modify the signal the it sends the data to the flight-controller.
